<p> <h3 id="aboutparagraph">The Hands In Need (HIN) is an upcoming non-profit organization located in the Caribbean.
  <br>
  <br>
  This organization aims to provide help to those who are less fortunate or who are struggling
  <br>
  <br>
  in these difficult times of Covid-19. Age is not a limit for joining this organization,
  <br>
  <br>
  but our main focus is to encourage young youths to join the organization. The plans for this
  <br>
  <br>
  organization are to carry out charitable actions around our country every two weeks
  <br>
  <br>
  with donations from its members and other who plan on donating. In conclusion, Hands In Need (HIN) will make
  <br>
  <br>
  great effort to accomplish all its goals and help all those suffering because of poverty.
